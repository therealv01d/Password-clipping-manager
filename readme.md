Wouldn't it be great if you just ran a script when your friends are around and it copies your complex strong password to the clipboard just like that.

How to use:
Sql hasn't been implemented till now so,
Insert your username, emails and password in the fields of username, user1 and password.
This doesn't have sql implementation right now, so you have to manually add it.
